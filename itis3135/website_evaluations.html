        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.gamestop.com">GameStop</a></h3>
            <p class="Left">GameStop Corp.is an American video game, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise retailer. 
                The company is headquartered in Grapevine, Texas, and is the largest video game retailer worldwide.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Contrast:</b> There are two colors that the website uses which 
                    is red and white which matches because the logo uses these colors. The body of
                    the page is also white and red, but the header stands out due to the bold font. 
                    The whole website is very clean and has a nice flow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Repitition:</b> The layout is very consistant repition, the fonts are very consistant
                    throughout the website and it uses sans serif.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Alignment:</b>The Alignments are very natural as each row have the games or consoles
                    listed very orderly like nothing is out of line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Proximity:</b> The elements of this website is actually pretty neat as everything  is in a rectangle or square.
                    It allows people to organize from different products because usually consoles are labeled with rectangles and games are usually in squares.
                </li>
            </ul>   
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></h3>
                <p class="Left">Yahoo inc.  is a global media and tech company connecting people to their passions and it can be for news and searching
                    other stuff.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Contrast:</b>The colors in this websiteis all white with little purple,
                        in my opinion it doesn't really seem natural as it's just really bland. When I click on a
                        link everything seems very spaced out and it just doesn't feel good. They also sometimes have
                        different color for a random word and this happens alot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Repitition:</b> The Repititon isn't bad but it isn't good because the website seems to have different styles
                        sometimes because like I said when I click on a link it just seems that they change the style in general and it went from being crowded
                        to being apart from each other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Alignment:</b> The Alignment is really bad because the homepage where it shows all the news stories it goes to what is in the news right now
                        to other random stories which isn't really consistant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Proximity:</b>The elements of the webpage is really crowded up when you open the website. All the links to the stories are so close together that
                        it doesn't seem like you can click on them.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Danny Higgins Contract</h2>
            <p>
                I, Danny Higgins agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2022
                ITIS 3135, Web Devlopment and Design with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly availble online tools will be available to world, and 
                will not put information there that is my work that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins
                or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class its possible
                to find many examples online or even view my classmates code directly. I swear I will only use these resources to learn, 
                and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit(i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            </p>
            <p>Signed: Danny Higgins, 9/14/2022</p>
